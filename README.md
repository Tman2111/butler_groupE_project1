Our project is to uncover patterns in music on Spotify between 2010 and 2019. We'll examine musical trends and genres through the years; which artists appeared most frequently.

* Did we see artists make the top ten for various years or just one?

* Do beats per minute correlate to ‘dancibility’?

* What is the statistical analysis for beats per minute?

* Are any of the songs outliers?

* What is the most popular genre?

* What is the least popular genre?

* Who is the most popular artist?

*Who is the least popular artist?
